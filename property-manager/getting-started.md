# Getting Started as a Property Manager

This page will walk you through getting started as a Property Manager.

## Adding Your First Property

::: tip
**Property** refers to a physical location that contains one or more **apartments**, **commercial units**, and/or **parking lots**.
:::

To add your first property, first create your personal account, then click the **Add Property** button. You will be prompted to enter basic details, as well as attach a photo to help identify this property. Both the description and photo are for your eyes only, to allow you to keep track of properties that you add.

### Verification

Once the property is created, you will be prompted to navigate to **Stripe** to verify your business details. This step will allow you to recieve payments, and completing it is necessary before you can initiate tenant leases.

Verification may be instant, or take up to 24 hours, and during that time, it is important that you check back throughout the verification process to ensure no additional information is needed.

Once the verification process has started, you can begin setting up your **Property** in Ktema Life.

## Setting Up Your Property

Once your property is created and the verification process is started, you can begin adding features to your property. Right away, you can begin adding **Apartments** and **Commercial Units**, and you can also invite additional managers to your Property's **team**. Additionally, you can add more **Properties** if you have rental units in other locations.

## Your Property's Subscription

Access to KtemaLife's features is based on a monthly **subscription**. Each Property has a subscription, and each subsciption is a mix-and-match of features that you choose to add for your property. **Rent collection** is a feature, as well as **Work Orders** and **Parking Lots**. Some of these features have prices that scale with units, like **Rent collection** scaling per apartment, while others are a flat rate. 

When trying to access a feature that is not currently part of your property's subsction, you will be prompted to add it. You may freely add and remove features from month to month.

*Failure to pay the monthly subscription fee may result in features being temporarily innaccessible. Failure to pay over an extended amount of time may result in features being completely disabled, such as rent collection.*
